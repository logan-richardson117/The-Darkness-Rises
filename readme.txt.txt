a thired leval had to be added at the last minate due to there was an error that acoured when building so the thired leval does not fully seem like the same game as the other 2 levals

the second leval dopes have enamys present that do not attack the player as the nav mesh did not work with the ennemys so dop make the leval seem a little bit more full i added in brakeable doors inorder to be able to have some 
playable game logic that gives the player a chalange

the menu does line up with the overall canvas as well as the camera i have atempted to fix this even looking it up the selution but could not figure out what the actuall problem was
